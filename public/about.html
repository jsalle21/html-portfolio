<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an aspiring web developer that wishes to flourish in the tech field. 
  My goal is to become a valued contributor to projects and companies that demand high quality websites that suits their needs.
  I also wish to create my own websites, whether it be a video game database or blog, and be able to manage and host them.
</p>

<p>My hobbies include video games, anime, manga, drawing, and playing the piano! 
  Separate from my web developer career goals, I desire to create my very own video game that hopefully many gamers around the world can enjoy and resonate with.
  In that regard, I am fairly versed with the game engines Unity and Unreal Engine.
</p>

<p>New experiences are always on the horizon, and inaction results in losing them forever.
  Therefore, it is my mission to remain headstrong and take those opportunities with fierce determination.
  My doors are always open for that chance of a lifetime.
